// Deterministic and side-effect-free: given ONE tenant's already-metered usage and their allocation (the
// paid/staked quota that #4792's rental ledger resolves), it decides whether the tenant is still within quota
// and, when not, which resource dimension was exhausted plus a clear, user-facing reason. It reads only the
// tenant it is handed, so evaluating one tenant can never observe or affect another's state — the isolation the
// multi-tenant quota model requires. It computes a decision only: it does NOT store usage, meter compute, or
// stop a loop; that enforcement wiring is a separate, maintainer-owned concern. Every numeric input is
// normalized first, so a non-finite, fractional, or negative usage/quota can never make a decision NaN,
// fractional, or negative. Mirrors the governor's pure rate-limit calculator (governor/rate-limit.ts).
