// Allowlist registry + governor-gated handler contract for chat-issued miner actions (#6519).
//
// Shared scaffolding ONLY: this module ships with ZERO registered actions. The three action-family child
// issues (portfolio release/requeue, governor pause/resume, discover/attempt) register their handlers into
// this registry -- none are added here, and the default `chatActionRegistry` instance starts empty.
//
// The registration contract is the safety boundary. `register` refuses any handler that was not produced by
// `governorGatedHandler()`, and `governorGatedHandler()` routes every invocation through
// `evaluateGovernorChokepointGate` (packages/loopover-miner/lib/governor-chokepoint.js) and, through it, the
// fail-closed precedence ladder in packages/loopover-engine/src/governor/chokepoint.ts. Because a raw
// function can never be registered, a chat action can never perform a write on a path that bypasses the
// Governor chokepoint -- the contract enforces it structurally, not by review discipline. This module adds
// no second, competing safety check; it only forces every registered handler onto the existing one.
